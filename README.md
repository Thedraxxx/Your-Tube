🎥 YouTube Clone (Backend-Focused Full Stack Project)
This is a YouTube Clone project built to deepen my understanding of real-world backend development using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
The goal was to go beyond tutorials and learn how to structure, build, and deploy a production-level backend with full API functionality and cloud storage integration.

🧠 What I Learned
🔧 Node.js & Express.js – building scalable and maintainable REST APIs

🧩 MVC structure – clean separation using routes, controllers, services, and config

☁️ Cloudinary – for video/image upload and storage

🌱 MongoDB – CRUD operations with advanced aggregation pipelines

📫 API Communication – connecting frontend and backend using real data

🧪 Postman – for API testing, debugging, and iteration

📁 Production-level file structure and organization

⚙️ Environment variable management, error handling, and async patterns

🛠 Tech Stack
🔹 Frontend
React.js

Tailwind CSS

Axios for API communication

Vercel for deployment

🔸 Backend
Node.js

Express.js

MongoDB with Mongoose

Cloudinary (for handling media uploads)

Postman (API testing tool)

Render for backend deployment

⚠️ Note: Render has some limitations – backend startup can be slow on free tier, and video uploads are limited to 10MB.
