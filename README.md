# 🎥 YouTube Clone (Backend-Focused Full Stack Project)

This is a **YouTube Clone project** built to deepen my understanding of real-world **backend development** using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. The goal was to go beyond tutorials and learn how to structure, build, and deploy a production-level backend with full API functionality and cloud storage integration.
