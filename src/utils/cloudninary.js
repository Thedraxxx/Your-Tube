// üöÄ Cloudinary Upload Function
// This function is designed to upload a local file to Cloudinary and handle the file efficiently.
// Here's how it works:
// 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Check for File Path**: It first checks if a file path is provided. If no path is found, the function returns `null`.
// 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Upload to Cloudinary**: If the file exists, it uploads the file to Cloudinary, and Cloudinary automatically detects the file type (whether it's an image, video, etc.)
// 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Cleanup**: After a successful upload, it deletes the file from local storage to keep things neat and save space. 
//    If the upload fails, it also deletes the file to prevent leaving temporary files behind.
// 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Return Data**: After the upload, the function returns Cloudinary's response, including the file URL and metadata so you can use it in your app. 
//    If the upload fails, it returns `null` to indicate an error, allowing you to handle the issue gracefully.

// üí° **Why use this?**
// ‚úÖ Files are automatically detected for their type, no need to specify.
// ‚úÖ It saves local storage space by deleting the file after upload.
// ‚úÖ Handles errors cleanly by ensuring no leftover files and returning useful information for failure cases.

// Always use this function for smooth, automatic file uploads to Cloudinary and keep your app's file handling clean and efficient.
